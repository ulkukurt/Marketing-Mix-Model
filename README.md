## Marketing Mix Modeling Project

This project focuses on Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), a statistical analysis technique used to understand the impact of various marketing channels on sales. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and includes advertising spend data for TV, radio, and newspaper, along with corresponding sales figures. The goal of this project is to quantify the effectiveness of each advertising channel and provide actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies.

### Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/code/imdineshgrewal/market-mix-modeling-using-sales-data/input?select=Advertising.csv
The dataset, originally from Kaggle, contains the following columns:

TV: Advertising spend on TV (in thousands of dollars)
Radio: Advertising spend on radio (in thousands of dollars)
Newspaper: Advertising spend on newspapers (in thousands of dollars)
Sales: Sales figures (in thousands of units)

## Analysis
The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between different variables, followed by building a multiple linear regression model to estimate the impact of each advertising channel on sales. The results indicate that TV and radio advertising have statistically significant positive impacts on sales, while newspaper advertising does not show a significant effect.

## Business Insights
Based on the model's findings:

TV Advertising: Highly effective in driving sales. Increasing the TV advertising budget can lead to substantial sales growth.
Radio Advertising: Also effective, though to a lesser extent than TV. It can be a valuable component of a balanced media mix.
Newspaper Advertising: Shows negligible impact on sales. Funds allocated to newspaper ads might be better utilized in more impactful channels like TV or radio.

These insights help marketers make data-driven decisions to optimize their marketing spend and maximize return on investment (ROI).
